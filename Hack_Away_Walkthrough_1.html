This keeps all our notes and downloaded files together. Good Practice.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-1.png" alt="images/1-1.png" /> </p><p></p><p></p><p>#  Let&#39;s start with first a basic nmap scan to quickly find out some of the ports that are running on the target machine.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-2.png" alt="images/1-2.png" /></p><p></p><p>							</p><p># Here we see from our basic nmap scan that FTP (21), SSH (22) and HTTP (80) are open and accessable. Before we start manually poking around, let&#39;s get a more in depth nmap scan running and save the output to our “hack_away” directory that we created. This way we can always go back and study the results if needed.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-3.png" alt="images/1-3.png" /></p><p>						</p><p>		</p><p># The deeper nmap scan tells us that anonymous login is allowed for the FTP service. This is always a good place to start manually prodding. Before we do that tho, we see that port 80 is open and running http apache. This is a website. It&#39;s always good practice to have some sort of recon running in the background so let&#39;s get a “gobuster” running which will find us any hidden url extensions (directories), we could possibly get access too. We can also save the output to our “hack_away” directory so we can always go back and study it at any time if we needed too.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-4.png" alt="images/1-4.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Here we can see there is a hidden directory called /secret.txt. Its status is a 200 which means we can access it. Let&#39;s take a look at this website.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-5.png" alt="images/1-5.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Here we see that the homepage is just the default apache config page. Nothing to interesting there. Let&#39;s visit the hidden directory we found &quot;/secret.txt&quot;.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-6.png" alt="images/1-6.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># This looks like a &quot;base64&quot; encoded string. Let&#39;s decode it.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-7.png" alt="images/1-7.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Looks like we have another hidden web directory. Let&#39;s take a look.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-8.png" alt="images/1-8.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Excellent, we have found the bonus flag. Looks like “base64” again. Let&#39;s decode it and submit the flag.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-9.png" alt="images/1-9.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Now let&#39;s get back to that ftp service with anonymous login allowed. We can connect and login with both the username and password as “anonymous”. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-10.png" alt="images/1-10.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># After loging in and doing a simple “ls” command, we see there is a zip file called “hackme”. Let&#39;s download it to our machine and play with it using a simple “get” command.</p><p></p><p></p><p># Attempting to unzip this file we see that it is password protected.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-11.png" alt="images/1-11.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p> # Let&#39;s see if we can crack the password using a tool called “fcrackzip” and the common “rockyou.txt” password list.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-12.png" alt="images/1-12.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Fcrackzip was successful in cracking the password. Let&#39;s unzip the file using the found password.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-13.png" alt="images/1-13.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Now we see in our directory we have the extracted files. We have &quot;steg_clue.txt&quot; and &quot;stego_image.jpg&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p># The name of these files hints straight towards some stegonography.</p><p></p><p></p><p># First let&#39;s take a look at &quot;steg_clue.txt&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-14.png" alt="images/1-14.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># We have a famous movie quote clue of &quot;Send A Maniac To Catch A ......&quot;.</p><p></p><p></p><p># Google helps us find the missing word at the end of the quote. Must be some sort of password.</p><p></p><p></p><p># Let&#39;s use a tool called &quot;steghide&quot; to find out if there is anything hidden in this stego_image.jpg we extracted and enter the movie quote word we found as the password.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-15.png" alt="images/1-15.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Now doing an &quot;ls&quot; in our hack_away directory we see steghide has extracted a file from the image called creds.txt. Let&#39;s take a look.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-16.png" alt="images/1-16.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># We now have a username and a hint to crack the users ftp login password with the password list “rockyou.txt”. Time to use a tool called “hydra”. This is going to take some time so remember to add an hour to the challenge and take a break while it runs.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-17.png" alt="images/1-17.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Looks like hydra has found us a password for that username. Let&#39;s see if we can login via ftp using them creds.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-18.png" alt="images/1-18.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># We see there is a “notes.txt” file so again lets use the “get” command and download it to our machine to take a look.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-19.png" alt="images/1-19.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Another clue stating we can possibly use the same credentials to login via ssh that we saw was running when we did our nmap scan. Let&#39;s try.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-20.png" alt="images/1-20.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># We have successfully logged in via ssh using them creds. Great. Let&#39;s take a look around the file system and see if we can find that user flag.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-21.png" alt="images/1-21.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># In the users home directory we find the user flag. It has a “.”  in front of it meaning it&#39;s hidden so a “ls -la” will display it. Great let&#39;s submit it. </p><p></p><p></p><p># Now to get root. Let&#39;s keep looking around the file system for anything that might aid us into escalating our privileges to root.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-22.png" alt="images/1-22.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># As we see doing a simple “find” command to search for anymore &quot;txt&quot; files on the target we do see one in the /opt directory called “important_secret.txt”. Let&#39;s navigate to it and take a look.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-23.png" alt="images/1-23.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># Here we see some sort of string with a clue to root hinting towards a “rot13” cypher. Let&#39;s use an online decypher tool.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-24.png" alt="images/1-24.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># We have a password. As the clue hinted towards root, lets attempt to login as root with this password.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-25.png" alt="images/1-25.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># It worked! Happy days ;-D. Now to get the root flag.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-26.png" alt="images/1-26.png" /></p><p></p><p></p><p># We did it! Great stuff! Submit the flag and complete the challenge.</p><p></p><p></p><p># Hope you enjoyed learning some basic hacking techniques with this machine i created.</p><p></p><p></p><p># Well done! Give yourself a pat on the back :-) </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
